# Field Notes

The useful part of this repository is the small rule set around token drift and label quality.

The domain cases cover `token drift`, `grammar width`, `label quality`, and `error locality`. They sit beside the smaller starter fixture so the project has both a compact scoring check and a domain-flavored review check.

The widest spread is between `label quality` and `token drift`, so those are the first two cases I would preserve during a refactor.

The extra check gives the repository a behavior path that can fail for a domain reason, not only a syntax reason.
